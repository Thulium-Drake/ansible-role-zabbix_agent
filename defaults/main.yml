# This list can contain 3 types of entries
# * A template that has no files, but has to be linked to a host (first example)
# * A supporting template that has a single file, but does not need to be linked to a host (second example)
# * A template that has files and has to be linked to a host (third example)
# * A template that also requires some extra software to be installed, and multiple files (fourth example)
